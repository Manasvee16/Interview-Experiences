# Flipkart Grid Experiences

## 1. Prototype the Problem Thoroughly – Flipkart GRID 5.0 Winner 🏆

**Experience by Prathamesh Parit** (GRID 5.0) ([Course Joiner][1])
**Key takeaways:**

* **Break the problem down**: List all requirements, split into sub-tasks.
* **Research deeply**: Use GitHub, research papers, ChatGPT—don't rely solely on existing code.
* **Own the solution**: If you can't find ready-made code, build it yourself.
* **Team dynamics matter**:

  > “Build a Strong Team… Regular updates twice a day… visually impactful presentations” ([Medium][2], [Reddit][3])
* **Present with confidence** — in Q\&A, demo, and slides.

## 2. Avoid Submission Nightmares – GRID 6.0 Participant

**Experience by Pranjal Jatav** (GRID 6.0) ([Medium][2])
**What went wrong:**

* Submission failed because PPT crashed and formatting broke.
  **Advice:**
* Finalize and submit all deliverables **at least an hour early**.
* Stick to provided **template formats**, no fancy tweaks.
* Keep it **minimal & clear**—focus on solution over flashiness.

## 3. Nail the Online DSA Round – Flipkart GRiD 7.0 Format

**Guidelines from Frontlines Media** ([Medium][4], [Frontlines Media][5])
**Round Structure:**

1. Profile-based resume screening
2. **90-min coding test** with DSA challenges
3. Case study + code
4. Finals: Team prototype + demo
   **Prep phases:**

* Build strong DSA foundations (arrays, graphs, DP)
* Practice **timed coding tests**
* Prepare full **case study submissions** (arch diagram, code, docs)

---

## 4. Excel in MCQ Rounds – GRID 5.0 Coverage

**Experience by Bhaswati Roy** (GRID 5.0) ([Frontlines Media][5], [Medium][6], [Reddit][7])
**What questions popped up:**

* DSA (expression evaluation, master theorem, traversals)
* Language output, heaps, hashing, C++/Java syntax
  **What to prepare:**
* Brush up on **DSA theory** and **CS basics**
* Revise complexity, traversals, master theorem thoroughly
* Stay alert for **platform anti-cheat quirks**

## 5. Build a Solid, Diverse Team – Reddit Wisdom

> “Building the Right Team… developers, designers, even someone with killer presentation skills.” ([Medium][6], [Reddit][8])
> Additional tips:

* **Prep your tech stack** & APIs in advance
* **Define an MVP**—don’t over-engineer
* **Set up environment** beforehand (GitHub, libs)
* **Plan roles**, track progress (Trello/GDocs)

### ✅ Next Actions for GRiD 7.0 Prep:

1. **Resume & projects**: polish for profile screening.
2. **DSA drills**: timed sessions, focus on GRiD-style MCQs & testcases.
3. **Case study practice**: do at least 2 real-world feature prototypes with code + design docs.
4. **Team strategy**: form group with defined roles; set prep milestones.
5. **Dry-run final submission**: test presentations + environment *a day before*.
