# ✅ Media.net Interview Preparation – Complete Guide

## 🧪 Round 1: Online Assessment (OA)

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Format:** 3–5 coding problems (moderate to hard)

### Key Topics:

* Binary Search on Answers
* DP with Bitmasking
* Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)
* Tree Construction
* Simulation / Custom Logic

---

## 💻 Round 2: Technical Interview – DSA + Core CS

**Duration:** 45–60 minutes
**Format:** Live coding + CS fundamentals

### Common DSA Problems:

* Linked List: Clone with random pointers, reversal in groups
* Trees: Construct from traversal, flatten
* Graphs: Number of connected components, simulation-based
* Sorting/Greedy: Arrange to form largest number, custom comparators

### CS Fundamentals (Be ready for):

* OS: Locks, deadlocks, process vs thread
* DBMS: Indexing, Normal Forms, Transactions
* CN: TCP vs UDP, 3-way handshake
* Java/OOP: Abstract vs Interface, Overriding vs Overloading

---

## 🧠 Round 3: Advanced DSA + Design (Optional for Interns)

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Format:** Hybrid problem + system discussion

### Example Questions:

* Hit Counter: Design a rate limiter for API
* Geo Queries: Return top N items in a rectangular area
* Tree with weights: Return average distances from root

---

## 🗣️ Round 4: Managerial / HR (Final Discussion)

**Duration:** 30–40 minutes
**Format:** Behavioral + Resume Deep Dive

### Topics:

* Project explanation with real use cases
* Debugging scenarios or failure recovery
* Why Media.net?
* How you handle deadlines, bugs, or conflicts

## 🧾 Common Themes Across Most Rounds

* Heavy use of **bitmasking** in DP-based problems
* Binary search is applied to **answers**, not just indices
* Expect simulation-heavy questions that test **logic clarity**
* Tree + Graphs + Grid-based problems show up frequently
* Interviewers often explore **resume** and ask domain-linked **design** questions
