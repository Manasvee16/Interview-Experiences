Q1. Given:  
N points on a 2D plane.  
An integer perimeter.  
You have to choose the lengths of sides (a, b) of a rectangle such that 2*(a+b) == perimeter.  
Rectangle sides must be parallel to axes.  
Place the rectangle to cover the maximum number of points.

Q2. Given a 3 × 3 grid which contains exactly nine stones within its cells.  
A cell may contain any number of stones.  
In each move, you can shift a stone from one cell to another if the two cells share a common side.  
The grid is described by a 3 × 3 matrix of integers A.  
Rows are numbered from 0 (top) to 2 (bottom).  
Columns are numbered from 0 (left) to 2 (right).  
A[K][J] represents the number of stones in the cell at row K and column J.  
Return the minimum number of moves required so that each cell ends up containing exactly one stone.
