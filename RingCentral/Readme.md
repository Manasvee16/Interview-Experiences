## Online Assessment – Hackerrank

- Format:  
  - 2 Coding Problems  
  - 11 MCQs (OS, DBMS, OOP, CN)  
- Coding: Medium to Hard (e.g., DP, Tree/Graph)  
- MCQs: Output-based or theory

### Prep Tips:

- Solve 100+ LeetCode medium-level questions
- Review CS core subjects from Neso Academy or Gate Smashers
- Take mock assessments on Hackerrank

---

## Technical Interview Rounds

### Round 1 (90 min)

- Introduction + Resume talk
- OOP concepts: polymorphism, inheritance, virtual functions
- Coding: Medium-level DSA problems (Stacks, Trees)

### Round 2 (90 min)

- Deep project discussion (Node.js, MongoDB, REST APIs)
- Network security: DES, AES, symmetric ciphers, zk-SNARK basics
- DSA: Greedy + Dynamic Programming questions

---

## Behavioral and HR Round

- "Tell me about yourself"
- Career goals, strength/weakness, conflict resolution
- Projects and resume validation
- Ask insightful questions about teams, role expectations

---

## Video Interview Tips

- Use a quiet, well-lit place with a clean background
- Dress formally even for virtual rounds
- Maintain eye contact and speak clearly
- Have a backup internet connection or mobile hotspot ready

## Practice Questions and Resources

### Topics:

- **DP/Greedy**: Coin Change, Activity Selection  
- **Tree/Graph**: LCA, Inorder Traversal, BFS/DFS  
- **OOP**: Implement polymorphic classes  
- **REST/API**: CRUD in Node.js  
- **Security**: Write short notes on encryption schemes

## Final Tips

1. Clarify if unsure, don’t fake answers
2. Talk through your thought process while coding
3. Ask the interviewer about their tech stack or challenges
4. Stay calm and confident — most selection depends on communication + clarity
